# FF Epic RPG handoff — 2026-10-06, paired r16 baseline

Read this first, then STAGES.md and QUEST_ENGINE.md. Z establishes the baseline; AA verifies
the default build after packaging. Next unused stage: AB.

Git attribution: the user requested all repository history and future commits use Slithe with
338753050+Slithe11964@users.noreply.github.com. Historical comparison references were updated after
rewriting author/committer metadata; all 47 tests pass. The original history bundle is kept outside
this repository in ../_archive/FFERPG-before-slithe-attribution-2026-10-06/. Map bytes are unchanged.

## Current maps

- **Develop/edit:** baseline/Reforged/FFERPG_0.9.7.3-r16.w3x.
- **Play in 1.29.2 or Reforged:** baseline/1.29.2/FFERPG_0.9.7.3-r16.w3x.
- baseline/manifest.json records hashes and provenance. build-config.json pins the development
  master. Both maps are tracked; generated release builds are ignored.

The user chose the parent-folder r16 as the starting point, then agreed to carry its edits into the
Reforged master and generate the matching classic copy. That input was already classic format.
Its substantive differences from Y were quest-log GUI/text and pathing; object field values were
unchanged. Most script differences came from JassHelper inlining. Z carries the quest-log/pathing
edits and complete object data into W's repaired editor layout, retaining the latest user-authored
Intro.j welcome wording. No new gameplay, dialogue or reward changes were made.

All 93 quests use QuestEngine. S is user-confirmed working. Later safeguards, V shared-context
cleanup and W editor pairing remain included. Bugs remain deferred by user request. The Chemist/
Ninja passive-art fix remains; Gaya selection settings are preserved. Flying Gaya/crow lines are
the client's Air-to-Ground Indicators, independent of conversion.

## Workflow

```powershell
.\build.ps1 -Stage AB
```

The builder selects changed enabled modules, syncs, normalizes pairing, orders libraries, runs
all map/source/quest/content/save checks, regressions and codec tests, then adds the header and
publishes new files without overwrite. Use -Base with the newest reviewed Reforged build for
incremental work. World Editor edits: enable JassHelper/vJass, Save As a new file, check it,
export/review source changes, then convert that saved file:

```powershell
.\make_129.ps1 -Map release/<editor-saved-map>.w3x
```

The converter uses the tracked classic baseline for map-info template/missing object defaults,
compiles the runtime against 1.29.2, preserves editor files and outputs the same basename under
release/1.29.2/. The local batch accepts the same arguments. No sibling toolkit/r7 dependency.

Keep .j sources CRLF; comment calculations only when non-trivial. Preserve behavior/dialogue/
rewards unless requested. Record builds in STAGES.md and update this handoff and local parent
RESUME_PROMPT.txt. Commit relevant changes. Read BUILDS.md before resolving source/runtime failures:
exact historical contracts are intentional; never regenerate them to silence new differences.

## Verification and pending tests

Z passes all gates and 2,000 codec cases. Packaging has 47 passing regression tests. Both editor
formats round-trip byte-exact with valid pairing. The classic baseline compiles for 1.29.2 and
passes check_map against the master: 1,503 startup triggers, no reorder. Selected r16 quest-log
GUI actions/pathing are preserved in both; object files/WTS are byte-identical in the Reforged
master. Classic runtime exactly matches the converter transform of the master.

The user confirms both paired maps are working great on 2026-10-06. This is the confirmed
development starting point for Reforged and 1.29.2. Specific multiplayer/save-load/cinematic coverage
was not itemized. A separate editor Save As was not explicitly confirmed. Test each future change
in both clients and use QUEST_TESTS.md for focused content.

GitHub readiness checked: baseline pair, sources, toolchain, contracts, fixtures and guides are
tracked. The local downgrade_129.bat/make_129.ps1 and every conversion dependency are included.
No MapToolkit installation or parent-folder r7 map is needed. Use Python 3; JassHelper/World Editor
are external requirements for editor saves. Historical source regressions require full Git history.

## Repository and archive

Keep baseline/, src/, tools/, docs/, wrappers and release/ for future outputs. Retain contracts,
fixtures, PHASE16.md/handoff CSV, system/content guides and source/object references. Historical
auditors remain: current regressions depend on the V auditor and Git history.

Old stages, reports, obsolete surveys/readability plan and scratch files are preserved at
`../_archive/FFERPG-before-r16-baseline-2026-10-06/`, including the original user r16, previous docs,
pre-cleanup diff and eleven already-deleted reports recovered from Git. Nothing published remotely.
Next: requested new content or further shared-state cleanup in PHASE16.md.
